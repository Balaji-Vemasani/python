       <p>
        Crunchy, sweet, and nutritious, carrots are a staple veggie in many people diets. 
        Carrots are high in phenolic compounds, such as chlorogenic, p-coumaric, and caffeic acids, 
        that help relax blood vessels and reduce inflammation, which may help lower blood pressure levels

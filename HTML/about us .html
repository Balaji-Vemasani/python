                They were the first to work on sentiment analysis. Their main aim was to classify text
by overall sentiment, not just by topic e.g., classifying movie review either positive or
negative. They apply machine learning algorithm on movie review database which
results that these algorithms out-perform human produced algorithms. The machine
learning algorithms they use are Na√Øve-Bayes, maximum entropy, and support vector
machines. They also conclude by examining various factors that classification of
sentiment is very challenging. They show supervised machine learning algorithms are
the base for sentiment analysis.

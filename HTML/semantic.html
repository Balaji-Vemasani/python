                <h3>machine learning</h3>
                <p>ML classifiers can be trained on large datasets, 
                    allowing them to learn and adapt to various language patterns. This enhances 
                    the accuracy of sentiment analysis, as the models can recognize and understand 
                    the context and nuances in different expressions.</p>

                <h3>natural language processing</h3>
                <p>Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is library in Python, which provides a base for
                    building programs and classification of data. NLTK is a collection of resources for
                    Python that can be used for text processing, classification, tagging and tokenization.
                    This toolbox plays a key role in transforming the text data in the tweets into a format
                    that can be used to extract sentiment from them</p>
